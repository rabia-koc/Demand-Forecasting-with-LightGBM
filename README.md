## History of Project:
* A chain of stores, 10 different stores and 50 different requests a 3-month demand forecast for its product. So, using some time series and machine learning techniques, a 3-month demand forecasting model will be created.

## History of Dataset:
* Information of 10 different stores and 50 different products in 5-year data of a chain of stores is located.

## Variables:
* date ---> Dates of Sales Data (There are no holiday effects or store closures.) 
* store ---> IDs of Stores (Unique number for each store.) 
* item ---> IDs of Products (Unique number for each product.) 
* sales ---> Number of Products Sold (The number of products sold from a particular store on a given date.)
